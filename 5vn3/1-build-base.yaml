#
# pestifer input configuration file to build a modified Env ectodomain using 5vn3 as an input
# 
# Main modifications:
#  - all non-HIV proteins omitted (sCD4s and Fabs)
#  - Gly_3 bridge to close the gap left by unresolved parts of V1/2 loops
#  - extension of all gp41 C-termini out to residue 670 as an alpha helix
#
# Other notes:
#  - all NAG's present in the input structure are retained
#  - all gaps due to zero-occupancy residues are closed by building in the zero-occupancy residues
#  - final structure is minimized and NVT-equilibrated for a very short 2400 steps
#
