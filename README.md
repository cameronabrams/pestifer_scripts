These are scripts used to generate a variety of MD systems using [pestifer](https://github.com/cameronabrams/pestifer).

## Contents

### 4zmj -- unliganded SOSIP HIV-1 Env ectodomain trimer

1. ``4zmj.yaml``: standard build with engineered mutations reversed and missing residues built in
2. ``4zmj-ds.yaml``: swapping of V1/2 domains by one protomer clockwise (looking down along trimer axis from trimer apex to viral membrane)
3. ``4zmj-ds.yaml``: swapping of V1/2 domains by one protomer counter-clockwise (looking down along trimer axis from trimer apex to viral membrane)

### 7xix -- ba2 SARS-CoV-2 spike

1. ``ba2.yaml``: standard build with engineered mutations reversed and full glycans added
2. ``ba286.yaml``: build of homology model for BA2.86
